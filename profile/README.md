# BitPebble - making crypto tangible

The vision is simple - managing crypto keys securely should be as simple as managing a physical collection of coins or pebbles.

A five year old can already keep track of physical items, store them, count them, hide them if needed or exchange them with friends.

Simple NFC cards to enable transactions with crypto, off-chain and off-line.

No insecure seed phrases that can be copied or complicated dedicated hardware setups.

Just simple physical NFC cards you can tap on any modern phone.

We're on a mission to release a set of easy to use NFC devices - BitPebbles - that help you keep all your crypto keys secret and uncloneable forever yet always available (and recoverable) to you with minimal fuss.

**Full self-custody** with top-notch security and features not (yet) available elsewhere.
